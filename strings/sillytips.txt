Occasionally the tip of the round might lie to you. Don't panic, this is normal.
Sometimes you won't be able to avoid dying no matter how good you are at the game. Try not to stress too much about it.
When a round ends nearly everything about it is lost forever, leave your salt behind with it.
Just like real life the entropy of the game can only increase with time. If things aren't on fire yet, just wait.
The more obscure and underused a game mechanic is, the less likely your victims are to be able to deal with it.
This is a game that is constantly being developed for. Expect things to be added, removed, fixed, and broken on a daily basis.
Just the tip?
Some people are unable to read text on a game where half of it is based on text.
